# Weather App
App created by <a href="https://youtu.be/iILFBGm_I9M" target="_blank">ASMR Programming</a> for their collection of <a href="https://github.com/AsmrProg-YT/100-days-of-javascript" target="_blank">100 days of JavaScript Coding Codes</a>.

I choose this project to practice how to code a weather app with JavaScript, use a <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">weather API</a> and get data from that API.
